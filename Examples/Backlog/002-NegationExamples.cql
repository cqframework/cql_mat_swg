Current consensus approach:

// Returns _all_ encounters, "negated" or not
["Encounter, Performed": "Inpatient"]

// Returns encounters _without_ a negation rationale (meaning they have not been "negated")
["Encounter, Performed": "Inpatient"] Encounter
  where Encounter.negationRationale is null

// Returns encounters _with_ a negation rationale (meaning they have been "negated")
["Encounter, Performed": "Inpatient"] Encounter
  where Encounter.negationRationale is not null

// Returns encounters with a _specific_ negation rationale
["Encounter, Performed": "Inpatient"] Encounter
  where Encounter.negationRationale in "Medical Reason"

not exists ( ["Encounter, Performed": "Inpatient"] Encounter where Encounter.principalDiagnosis in "Diabetes" )

["Laboratory Test, Performed"] LaboratoryTest where LaboratoryTest.result is null

["Not Applied"]
["Not Dispensed"]
["Not Administered"]
["Not Ordered"]
