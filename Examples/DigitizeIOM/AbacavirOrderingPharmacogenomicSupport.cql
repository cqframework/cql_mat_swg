/*

For each order of abacavir for a patient

  Select all records from the patient's records that contain the LOINC observation code: 50956-2^HLA-B*57:01^LN

    If no records are found
      Trigger an intervention in the form of a alert (CommunicationRequest) with the following two parts:
        1. A high level concise description of the issue in a format similar to a drug allergy or interaction alert
        2. A more detailed textual description potentially based on the 2014 CPIC guidelines:
          "A HLA-B*57:01 genotype test is recommended before prescribing abacavir per the FDA's black box warning
          regarding the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients that carry this allele. A HLA-B*57:01
          genotype test does not appear to have been ordered for this patient. Please do the following to order the
          HLA-B*57:01 genotype test <<insert dialogue boxes here to order clinical HLA-B test>>"

    Else if the records contain conflicting statuses - one “10828004^Positive^SCT” the other “260385009^Negative^SCT”
      Trigger an intervention in the form of an alert with the following textual description:
        "There are two conflicting results for this patient. Consult with a clinical pharmacist or laboratory
        professional to resolve the conflict."  TODO: Should we enable this consult in the CQL?

    Else if any of the records contain the status “10828004^Positive^SCT”
      Trigger an intervention in the form of an alert with the following textual description
      (formatted in a manner that is consistent with a drug allergy or interaction alert):
        "The HLA-B*57:01 allele is present in this patient. This allele is associated with high risk of severe
        hypersensitivity to abacavir. HLA-B*57:01 positive patients should NOT be prescribed abacavir. Please
        choose an alternate antiretroviral. For more information, please consult a <<recommended clinical
        professional for consultation, for example some institutions might direct to a clinical pharmacist>>."
        NOTE: If the CDS capability exists, the clinician should be presented a list of acceptable alternative
              drugs to simplify the proper replacement of the order.
