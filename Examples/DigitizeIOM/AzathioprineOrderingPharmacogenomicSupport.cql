/*

For each order of Azathioprine for a patient

  Select all records from the patient's records that contain the LOINC observation code: 79713-4 (TPMT gene)

    If no records were found
      Alert the user with the following message:
        "TPMT test is recommended before using a thiopurine (mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and azathioprine).
        A TPMT genotype test does not appear to have been ordered for this patient."

    Else if the records contain conflicting statuses: “LA25391-6^Normal Metabolizer^LN-ANS” and another of
    “LA10317-8^Intermediate Metabolizer^LN-ANS" or "LA9657-3^Poor Metabolizer^LN-ANS Metabolizer^LN-ANS”, alert
    the user with the following message:
      "There are two or more conflicting TPMT results for this patient which must be resolved.
      Consult a clinical pharmacist or laboratory professional to resolve."  TODO: Should we enable this consult in the CQL?

    Else if the records contain the status “LA10317-8^Intermediate Metabolizer^LN-ANS"
      Alert the user with the following messages:
        High Level Message: "Testing has been performed and indicates that this patient is at INCREASED risk
          for myelotoxicity with standard dosing of thiopurine therapy."
        Explanation: "Based on a test result, this patient is predicted to be an intermediate TPMT metabolizer.
          The patient is at risk for myelosuppression with normal doses of azathioprine. A normal starting dose
          of azathioprine (e.g. 2-3 mg/kg/day) should be reduced to 0.6 – 2 mg/kg/day. Please consult a
          <<recommended clinical professional for consultation, for example some institutions might direct to a clinical pharmacist>>.
          [The alert may also refer the user to additional information within the system.]"

    Else if the most recent record contains the status "LA9657-3^Poor Metabolizer^LN-ANS Metabolizer^LN-ANS”
      Alert the user with the following messages:
        High-level Message: "Testing has been performed and indicates that this patient is at VERY HIGH risk
          for myelotoxicity with standard dosing of thiopurine therapy"
        Explanation: "Based on the result, this patient is predicted to have low or absent TPMT activity.
          The patient is at high risk for life-threatening myelosuppression with normal doses of azathioprine.
          Azathioprine should be avoided, or if azathioprine is given, start by reducing the does by 10-fold and
          administer thrice weekly instead of daily. Please consult a
          <<recommended clinical professional for consultation, for example some institutions might direct to a clinical pharmacist>>..
          [The alert may also refer the user to additional information within the system.]"
